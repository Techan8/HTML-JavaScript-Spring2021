            <p>My name is Maite Boaventura, I was born October 12, 1987 in Paris, also known as <i>"the city of
                    love"</i> in
                France.
                My parents originated from Cape Verde, they moved to France both at a young age.
                I am 33 years old, married and the happy mother of a beautiful little boy.
                I attended <b>Louise Michel High School</b> and graduated in 2006. In 2010 while on a trip to the
                US, I met
                my husband of whom I've been married to for almost 6 years.
                I moved to America about 5 years ago almost 6 now. Building my new life in Rhode Island after 27
                years old
                was difficult at first, but with the support and love from my husband and his family, I was able to
                adjust
                quickly.
                The medical field was my first work experience in this country. I worked as a Certified Nursing Aid
                (CNA),
                then obtained a certificate to become a Certified Medical Technician (CMT) from August 2017 until
                January
                2019.
                After having my son, I had the opportunity to work at Providence Community Health Centers (PCHC) as
                a
                Customer Service Representative (CSR).
                It was a great experience however, I wasn't interested enough to continue in this field.
                My husband encouraged me to go back to school into a field that I would be passionate about.
                This is how I decided to enroll into the ,<strong>Video Game Design and Development Program at New
                    Institute of Technology (NEIT).</strong>
