        <p>My name is Maite Boaventura, I was born October 12, 1987 in Paris, also known as <i>"the city of
                love"</i> in
            France.
            My parents originated from Cape Verde, they moved to France both at a young age.
            I am 33 years old, married and the happy mother of a beautiful little boy.
            I attended <b>Louise Michel High School</b> and graduated in 2006. In 2010 while on a trip to the
            US, I met
            my husband of whom I've been married to for almost 6 years.
            I moved to America about 5 years ago almost 6 now. Building my new life in Rhode Island after 27
            years old
            was difficult at first, but with the support and love from my husband and his family, I was able to
            adjust
            quickly.
            The medical field was my first work experience in this country. I worked as a Certified Nursing Aid
            (CNA),
            then obtained a certificate to become a Certified Medical Technician (CMT) from August 2017 until
            January
            2019.
            After having my son, I had the opportunity to work at Providence Community Health Centers (PCHC) as
            a
            Customer Service Representative (CSR).
            It was a great experience however, I wasn't interested enough to continue in this field.
            My husband encouraged me to go back to school into a field that I would be passionate about.
            This is how I decided to enroll into the ,<strong>Video Game Design and Development Program at New
                England
                Institute of Technology (NEIT)</strong>.</p>
        <p>My passion for video games started when I was a child.
            I used to play Super Mario Bros on GameBoy but everything changed when my father gifted me with a
            Playstation.
            My siblings and I played for hours in a day. I remember playing platform games like <em>Crash
                Bandicoot</em>
            and <em>Spyro the dragon</em>, fighting games like <em>Tekken 3</em> etc.
            Back then, it was not common for a girl to play video games.
            At school I used to discuss with other classmates about video games and we used to exchange our
            games.
            One of my friend introduced me to <em>Final Fantasy</em>. I first played <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>
            and
            really enjoyed it, sparking my interest for RPGs.
            One day, I was offered to try <em>Final Fantasy X</em> on Playstation 2. The difference between both
            games
            was incredible.
            I was immediately seduced by the design and the innovative gameplay. Since then, I have been mostly
            playing
            RPGs as it is my favorite kind of gameplay.</p>
        <p>Drawing has also always been part of my life. I started drawing <em>Disney</em> characters when I was
            10
            years old.
            I quickly escalated to manga and anime drawing style as I was discovering the comics.
            After high school I wanted to attend a private school to learn how to become a Graphic Design Comic
            Artist.
            Unfortunately, my parents couldn't afford the tuition, I had to abandon the idea of ever becoming a
            Comic
            Artist.
            Now that I am an adult, I have the possibility to fulfill my dream on a higher level by becoming a
            Video
            Game Artist. Therefore, I am starting my journey at <a href="https://www.neit.edu/" target="blank">New
                England
                Institute of Technology</a>.</p>
