    <h1>Maite Boaventura</h1>
    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <img src="images/profile picture.jpg" alt="profile picture" width="150" height="200">
    <p>My name is Maite Boaventura. I was born October 12, 1987 in Paris, also known as "the city of love" in France. 
        I am 33 years old, I am married and the happy mother of beautiful little boy.
        I lived for 27 years in France, therefore I am fluent in french. I studied there until High School which I graduated in 2006.
        I met my husband here in the US back in 2010. After severals travels between France and Boston, I decided to quit my country and start a new life with him. 
        I moved to America about 5 years ago almost 6 now. Getting used to my new life wasn't easy at first, but with the advices and help from my husband and his family, I was able to fit in quickly.
        Until last month, I was working in the medical field. I was at first a Certified Nursing Aid (CNA), then upgraded to Certified Medical Technician (CMT) from August 2017 until January 2019.
        After having my son, I had the opportunity to work at Providence Community Health Centers (PCHC) as a Customer Service Representative (CSR). 
        The experience was very interesting but I wasn't passionate enough to continue in this field for a lifetime.
        My husband pushed me to go back to school into a field that I would be interested in.
        This is how I decided to enroll into the Video Game Design and Development Program at New England Institute of Technology (NEIT).</p>
    
        <P>My passion for video games started when I was a child. 
        I used to play Super Mario Bros on GameBoy but everything changed when my father offered me a Playstation.
        My siblings and I used to play for hours without being tired of it. I remember playing platform games like Crash Bandicoot or Spyro the dragon.
        My uncle who used to play, would bring many other games for us to play. 
        Back then, it was not common for a girl to play video games. 
        At school I used to discuss with other classmates about video games and we used to exchange our games. 
        One of my friend introduced me to Final Fantasy. I first played Final Fantasy VI and really enjoyed it, sparking my interest for RPGs.
        One day, I was offered to try Final Fantasy X on Playstation 2. The difference between both games was incredible. 
        I was immediately seduced by the design and the innovative gameplay. 
        I also have a huge interest in drawing. I started drawing Disney characters when I was 10 years old. 
        I quickly escalated to manga and anime drawing style.
