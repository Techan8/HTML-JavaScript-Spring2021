    <h2 style="color: whitesmoke;">My Bio</h2>
    <img src="images/profile%20picture.jpg" alt="Profile%20picture" width="220" height="300">
    <p style="color: whitesmoke"> My name is Maite Boaventura, I was born October 12, 1987 in Paris, also known as <i>"the city of love"</i> in France. 
        My parents originated from Cape Verde, they moved to France both at a young age.
        I am 33 years old, married and the happy mother of a beautiful little boy.
        I attended <b>Louise Michel High School</b> and graduated in 2006. In 2010 while on a trip to the US, I met my husband of whom I've been married to for almost 6 years. 
        I moved to America about 5 years ago almost 6 now. Building my new life in Rhode Island after 27 years old was difficult at first, but with the support and love from my husband and his family, I was able to adjust quickly.
        The medical field was my first work experience in this country. I worked as a Certified Nursing Aid (CNA), then obtained a certificate to become a Certified Medical Technician (CMT) from August 2017 until January 2019.
        After having my son, I had the opportunity to work at Providence Community Health Centers (PCHC) as a Customer Service Representative (CSR). 
        It was a great experience however, I wasn't interested enough to continue in this field.
        My husband encouraged me to go back to school into a field that I would be passionate about.
        This is how I decided to enroll into the ,<strong>Video Game Design and Development Program at New England Institute of Technology (NEIT)</strong>.</p>
    
    <p style="color: whitesmoke;">My passion for video games started when I was a child. 
        I used to play Super Mario Bros on GameBoy but everything changed when my father gifted me with a Playstation.
        My siblings and I played for hours in a day. I remember playing platform games like <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> and <em>Spyro the dragon</em>, fighting games like <em>Tekken 3</em> etc. 
        Back then, it was not common for a girl to play video games. 
        At school I used to discuss with other classmates about video games and we used to exchange our games. 
        One of my friend introduced me to <em>Final Fantasy</em>. I first played <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> and really enjoyed it, sparking my interest for RPGs.
        One day, I was offered to try <em>Final Fantasy X</em> on Playstation 2. The difference between both games was incredible. 
        I was immediately seduced by the design and the innovative gameplay. Since then, I have been mostly playing RPGs as it is my favorite kind of gameplay. </p>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke"> Drawing has also always been part of my life. I started drawing <em>Disney</em> characters when I was 10 years old. 
        I quickly escalated to manga and anime drawing style as I was discovering the comics. 
        After high school I wanted to attend a private school to learn how to become a Graphic Design Comic Artist. 
        Unfortunately, my parents couldn't afford the tuition, I had to abandon the idea of ever becoming a Comic Artist.
        Now that I am an adult, I have the possibility to fulfill my dream on a higher level by becoming a Video Game Artist. Therefore, I am starting my journey at New England Institute of Technology.
