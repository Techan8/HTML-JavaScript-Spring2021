    <h1>Maite Boaventura</h1>
    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <img src="images/profile picture.jpg" alt="profile picture" width="150" height="200">
    <p>My name is Maite Boaventura, I was born October 12, 1987 in Paris, also known as "the city of love" in France. 
        My parents originated from Cape Verde, they moved to France both at a young age.
        I am 33 years old, married and the happy mother of a beautiful little boy.
        I attended Louise Michel High School and graduated in 2006. In 2010 while on a trip to the US, I met my husband of whom I've been married to for almost 6 years. 
        I moved to America about 5 years ago almost 6 now. Building my new life in Rhode Island after 27 years was difficult at first, but with the support and love from my husband and his family, I was able to adjust quickly.
        The medical field was my first work experience in this country. I worked as a Certified Nursing Aid (CNA), then obtained a certificate to become a Certified Medical Technician (CMT) from August 2017 until January 2019.
        After having my son, I had the opportunity to work at Providence Community Health Centers (PCHC) as a Customer Service Representative (CSR). 
        It was a great experience however, I wasn't interested enough to continue in this field.
        My husband encouraged me to go back to school into a field that I would be passionate about.
        This is how I decided to enroll into the Video Game Design and Development Program at New England Institute of Technology (NEIT).</p>
    
        <P>My passion for video games started when I was a child. 
        I used to play Super Mario Bros on GameBoy but everything changed when my father gifted me with a Playstation.
        My siblings and I played for hours in a day. I remember playing platform games like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the dragon, fighting games like Tekken 3 etc. 
        Back then, it was not common for a girl to play video games. 
        At school I used to discuss with other classmates about video games and we used to exchange our games. 
        One of my friend introduced me to Final Fantasy. I first played Final Fantasy VI and really enjoyed it, sparking my interest for RPGs.
        One day, I was offered to try Final Fantasy X on Playstation 2. The difference between both games was incredible. 
        I was immediately seduced by the design and the innovative gameplay. 
        I also have a huge interest in drawing. I started drawing Disney characters when I was 10 years old. 
        I quickly escalated to manga and anime drawing style.
